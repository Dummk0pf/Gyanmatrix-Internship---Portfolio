# Gyanmatrix-Internship---Portfolio
# This is my first website created from scratch excluding the ones I created during my study
# It is very simple , it is not yet resposive as there are three more to compelete 
# I tried to make it a bit flashy with some animations using CSS3
# As of now there is no cross browser support 

This is important 
This website is not broken if you can see the tags in headings 
for example in the main page "portfolio" has html tags wrapped
This is just a new design I tried to implement
You can open up the index.html to verify that the tags are deliberate
