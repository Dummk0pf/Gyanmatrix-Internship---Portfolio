# Gyanmatrix-Internship---Portfolio
 This is my first website created from scratch excluding the ones I created during my study
 I tried to make it a bit flashy with some animations using CSS3

# As of now there is no cross browser support 
# As of now the website is not responsive

This is important 
This website is not broken if you can see the tags in headings 
for example in the main page "portfolio" has html tags wrapped
This is just a new design I tried to implement
You can open up the index.html to verify that the tags are deliberate

I have changed the about me section as it was a little too corny
